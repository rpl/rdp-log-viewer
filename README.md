rdp-log-viewer
==============

Status: **PROOF OF CONCEPT**

This small webapp is an experimental viewer / editor for log files
collected by its companion addon-sdk library:

[rdp-logging](https://github.com/rpl/rdp-logging)


Using **rdp-logging** (or another equivalent tool) we can collect
**Mozilla Remote Debugger Procotol** exchanged messages into a
simple json format file, and then (using a viewer like this)
we can render it into a readable sequence diagram (a very simple UML Sequence Diagram)
and optionally tweak it using the embedded editor (e.g. to design a change
in the protocol).

This prototype is based on the following opensource projects:

- [js-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams)
- [RaphaÃ«l](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael)
- [CodeMirror](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror)
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/boostrap)
- [Lo-Dash](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash)
- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)

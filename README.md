rdp-log-viewer
==============

This small webapp is an experimental viewer / editor for log files
collected by its companion addon-sdk library:

[rdp-logging](https://github.com/rpl/rdp-logging)


Using **rdp-logging** (or another equivalent tool) we can collect
**Mozilla Remote Debugger Procotol** exchanged messages into a
simple json format file, and then (using a viewer like this)
we can render it into a readable sequence diagram (a very simple UML Sequence Diagram)
and optionally tweak it using the embedded editor (e.g. to design a change
in the protocol).
